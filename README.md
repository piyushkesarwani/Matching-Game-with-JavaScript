# Matching-Game-with-JavaScript
This is another game which is developed by me with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is called as Matching Card game and the rule here is that you have to match two cards by constantly clicking at any of the cards in the game board. The game finishes when you have matched all your cards.
